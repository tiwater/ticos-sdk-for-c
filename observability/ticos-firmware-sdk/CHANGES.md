### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.37.0 and SDK 0.36.1 - Dec 16, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Built-in Metrics

  - Add `TicosSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur` metric. This metric uses
    the platform's reboot register and any reasons by the SDK function
    `ticos_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent` to classify a reboot. When
    reboot tracking determines a reboot is unexpected, this metric is set to 1.
    Otherwise this metric is 0.

- [ModusToolbox:tm: Software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/)

  - Add log capture during coredump to port

- Demo CLI
  - Add `tcs test loadaddr` command. This comamnd is used to test specific
    faults due to protected regions

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- Built-in Metrics
  - The built-in metric, `TicosSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur`,
    classifies all reboot reasons greater than or equal to
    `kMfltRebootReason_UnknownError` **or** equal to `kMfltRebootReason_Unknown`
    as "unexpected reboots". It is recommended to ensure your platform's
    implementation of `ticos_reboot_reason_get` classifies the reboot
    register values as accurately and precisely as possible to avoid incorrect
    metric values.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.36.1 and SDK 0.36.0 - Dec 9, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- ESP-IDF:
  - Fix a bug üêõ in the [ESP32 example app](examples/esp32), where wifi join
    fails when using versions of ESP-IDF prior to 5.0

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.36.0 and SDK 0.35.0 - Dec 6, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- ESP-IDF:

  - Add support for
    [just-released ESP-IDF v5](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v5.0)
    üéâ! Thanks to @jlubawy and the patch supplied in #39 for this, very much
    appreciated!
  - Add an auto-OTA (and auto-WiFi-join) feature to the
    [ESP32 example app](examples/esp32)- enabled by default but can be disabled
    with Kconfig

- The [Heap Stats tracing component](https://ticos.io/mcu-heap-stats) has been
  revamped to make more efficient usage of the bookeeping structure. Usage
  should be the same as before, but now should provide more data without
  significantly expanding the memory utilization.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.35.0 and SDK 0.34.2 - Nov 22, 2022

#### :rocket: New Features

- **Experimental** Custom Data Recording API
  - Allows sending custom data collected over the course of a recording period

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr:
  - Modify heap stats to only collect info during allocations/deallocations from
    threads
- ESP-IDF:
  - ESP32 reboot tracking into RTC noinit
- nRF5 SDK:
  - NRF5 coredump regions -Wunused-macros, fixes warning for unused macros

#### :house: Internal

- Experiment: pytest as fw test frontend
- README: Add additional details on port integration

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.34.2 and SDK 0.34.1 - Nov 8, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- [ModusToolbox:tm: Software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/)
  - Updates SDK for compatibility with MTB 3.0

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.34.1 and SDK 0.34.0 - Nov 7, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- nRF-Connect:
  - Updates for Zephyr upmerge 2022.11.03 (see #35 + #36)
  - Fix watchdog test (`tcs test hang`) in
    [`examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf5/`](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf5/)
- Zephyr:
  - Set `CONFIG_QEMU_ICOUNT=n` in
    [`examples/zephyr/qemu/`](examples/zephyr/qemu/), which fixes the emulated
    target execution speed
  - Add heap free and stack usage Metrics to
    [`examples/zephyr/qemu/`](examples/zephyr/qemu/)
- Update the `ticos_demo_cli_cmd_assert()` test command to take a single arg,
  which is used in `TICOS_ASSERT_RECORD()`. This enables testing that assert
  variant from the CLI.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.34.0 and SDK 0.33.5 - Nov 1, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Misc ESP32 [port](ports/esp_idf) &
  [example app](examples/esp32/apps/ticos_demo_app) improvements
  - Added diagnostic print line containing Build Id at boot up
  - Improved messaging displayed when using `ticos_ota_check` test command
  - Example app now prints device info on bootup
  - Fix an issue where incremental build (`idf.py build && idf.py build`) would
    report a nuisance failure.
  - Flatten + simplify the directory structure of the QEMU based example project
- A new [`ports/mbedtls`](ports/mbedtls) is available, which implements a basic
  Mbed TLS client for performing Ticos data upload.
- Zephyr: Collect sysheap stats using the
  [Ticos Heap Tracking](https://ticos.io/mcu-heap-stats) component. This is
  configured with the `CONFIG_TICOS_HEAP_STATS` Kconfig option (enabled by
  default), and will track allocations done with `k_malloc()`.
- Fix an enum-mismatch warning in `ticos_metrics.c` when using the ARMCC v5
  compiler.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are using the ESP32 HTTP Client, the Ticos Project Key is now
  configured directly via the
  [ESP32 Project Configuration System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/kconfig.html).
  You need to do the following:
  1. Remove the `g_tcs_http_client_config` in your platform port
  2. Add `CONFIG_TICOS_PROJECT_KEY="YOUR_PROJECT_KEY"` to your projects
     `sdkconfig.defaults`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.4 and SDK 0.33.5 - Oct 19, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- nRF-Connect: Update the nRF9160 example application,
  `examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160`, to build and run correctly with
  nRF-Connect SDK v2.1.0
- Zephyr: Add an example Zephyr application targeting the QEMU board
- ESP-IDF:
  - Add a configuration option for setting the ESP-IDF HTTP client timeout value
  - Fix compilation for the ESP32-S3. _Note: coredumps are currently only
    supported on the ESP32, not the ESP32-S2, -S3, or -C3. This change only
    fixes compiling for the -S3 platform_
  - Add support for ESP-IDF v4.2.3

#### :house: Internal

- Support building the unit tests with GCC 12
- Miscellaneous fixes to unit test infrastructure to better support building in
  Mac OSX

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.3 and SDK 0.33.4 - Sept 15, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr port updates:
  - Handle thread abort in the task stack capture hook. Previous to this change,
    aborted tasks would remain on the captured task list, and restarting the
    task would create a duplicate entry.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.2 and SDK 0.33.3 - Sept 14, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr port updates:
  - Add a call to `LOG_PANIC()` before running the Ticos fault handler, to
    flush any deferred logs before the reboot

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.1 and SDK 0.33.2 - Sept 7, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr port updates:
  - fix a few minor nuisance build warnings on niche Zephyr configurations
  - enable `LOG_OUTPUT` when `TICOS_LOGGING_ENABLE` is enabled- this fixes a
    build error if all other log backends are disabled. thanks to @balaji-nordic
    for this fix! closes #33
- Add a debug cli test command to the nRF-Connect SDK port for printing the OTA
  url

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.0 and SDK 0.33.1 - Aug 26, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fix a :bug: in the heap stats component (#32), thanks @christophgreen for
  reporting it!
- Zephyr port updates:
  - add support for the newly namespaced Zephyr include path in upcoming Zephyr
    v3.2 (`#include <zephyr.h>` ‚Üí `#include <zephyr/zephyr.h>`). The includes
    were moved
    [prior to v3.1](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/53ef68d4598b2f9005c5da3fc0b860ca1999d350)
    of Zephyr, but v3.2
    [changes the backwards compatibility support to opt-in](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/1ec0c6f5308937dc8e77acc2567d6f53cdd7a74e).
    The Ticos SDK is now updated to support both.
  - fix Zephyr Ticos log capture to have the correct prefix in the decoded
    output when using LOG2 - previously all log lines regardless of level would
    have an `E` prefix (regression introduced in Ticos SDK version 0.32.0)
  - fix Zephyr Ticos log capture when in `CONFIG_LOG_MODE_IMMEDIATE` and
    using LOG2 to capture the full log line instead of each logged character as
    a separate line.

#### :house: Internal

- Zephyr port folder for `v2.x` migrated to `common`, now that Zephyr v1.14
  support has been removed (done in v0.32.0 of the Ticos SDK)
- Update README's for the example projects to match the new demo shell command
  structure (`crash 1` ‚Üí `test_hardfault`, etc).
- Tidy up nrf9160 example app Kconfig setup
- Fix parallel unit test invocation

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.33.0 and SDK 0.32.2 - Aug 18, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Extend [ticos demo shell](components/demo/src/ticos_demo_shell.c) to
  support terminals that only emit CR for line endings
- nRF5 SDK Updates:
  - Added a [software watchdog](https://ticos.io/root-cause-watchdogs) reference
    port for nRF5 SDK which makes use of the RTC Peripheral. See
    [ports/nrf5_sdk/software_watchdog.c](ports/nrf5_sdk/software_watchdog.c) for
    more details.
  - Updated [nRF5 example app](examples/nrf5/apps/ticos_demo_app/) to make
    use of hardware and new software watchdog port.
- Zephyr Port Updates:
  - Added Kconfig option to fallback to using `printk` by default when no
    logging is enabled. This can be disabled by setting
    `CONFIG_TICOS_PLATFORM_LOG_FALLBACK_TO_PRINTK=n`.
- nRF Connect SDK Updates:
  - Fixed a :bug: which could result in download errors when using
    [Ticos nRF Connect SDK FOTA client](ports/nrf-connect-sdk/zephyr/include/ticos/nrfconnect_port/fota.h)
    and enabled client in example application by default.
  - Added new example application for trying Ticos with nRF53 & nRF52 based
    development kits. See
    [examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf5](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf5) for more
    details.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.32.2 and SDK 0.32.1 - Aug 16, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr port: added a fix for upcoming Zephyr 3.2 compatibility, thanks
  @nordicjm for the fix!

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.32.1 and SDK 0.32.0 - Aug 8, 2022

#### :house: Internal

- Added default config header for PSoC 6 port
  [ports/cypress/psoc6/psoc6_default_config.h](ports/cypress/psoc6/psoc6_default_config.h)
  so user doesn't have to create it

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.32.0 and SDK 0.31.5 - Aug 8, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- [ModusToolbox:tm: Software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/)
  port updates
  - Added heartbeat metrics for heap and Wi-Fi performance tracking when using
    the default port for
    [CAT1A (PSoC:tm: 6)](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-pdl-cat1). See
    [ports/cypress/psoc6/ticos_platform_core.c](ports/cypress/psoc6/ticos_platform_core.c)
    for more details
  - Fixed reboot reason reported when PSoC 6 is fully reset to report "Power On
    Reset" instead of "Unknown"
- Zephyr port updates
  - Ticos logs (eg `TICOS_LOG_DEBUG()` etc) are now routed to the Zephyr
    logging infrastructure. The typical set of Kconfig options for Ticos logs
    are available (`CONFIG_TICOS_LOG_LEVEL_WRN` etc). See details in
    "Breaking Changes" below for enabling logs in your project.
  - Added a new Kconfig option, `TICOS_ZEPHYR_FATAL_HANDLER`, which can be
    used to disable the Zephyr fault handler print facilities.
  - Streamline support for nRF-Connect SDK based applications that don't need
    the Ticos root certificates (eg nRF53 or nRF52 devices), via a new
    Kconfig option `TICOS_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE`, to avoid a nuisance build error

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- Users will no longer see internal Ticos log output by default, but will
  have to enable it explicitly to see the output:

  ```ini
  # enable LOG
  CONFIG_LOG=y
  # not required- enabling the Ticos logging component enables including the
  # log buffer in coredumps
  CONFIG_TICOS_LOGGING_ENABLE=y

  # if on pre-v3.1.0 zephyr, you can choose either the default LOG v1
  # implementation, or select a LOG2 mode to enable LOG2. on zephyr 3.1.0+, LOG
  # v1 is removed and LOG v2 is now the only log implementation
  # CONFIG_LOG2_MODE_DEFERRED=y

  # make sure to select a log backend to see the output
  CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y
  ```

  The log statements affected by this change are likely only the internal
  Ticos SDK logs (`TICOS_LOG_DEBUG()` etc), unless those macros are used
  in the user application.

- Removed support for Zephyr LTS release 1.14 as it was superseded by
  [LTS V2 almost a year ago now](https://www.zephyrproject.org/zephyr-lts-v2-release/).
  A project using this release of Zephyr must target a ticos-firmware-sdk
  release less than 0.32.0.

#### :house: Internal

- More logically grouped Kconfig settings in Zephyr example app's
  [prj.conf](examples/zephyr/apps/ticos_demo_app/prj.conf)
- Fixed a few typos in particle port documentation
- Simplified compilation steps for the
  [nRF91 sample test app](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160/ticos_demo_app)
  when compiling with older releases of the nRF Connect SDK and refreshed the
  example to target the v2.0.2 release by default
- Updated default demo CLI commands to better align with
  [our suggested integration test commands](https://ticos.io/mcu-test-commands).
  The default set now looks like this:

  ```bash
  tcs> help
  clear_core: Clear an existing coredump
  drain_chunks: Flushes queued Ticos data. To upload data see https://ticos.io/posting-chunks-with-gdb
  export: Export base64-encoded chunks. To upload data see https://ticos.io/chunk-data-export
  get_core: Get coredump info
  get_device_info: Get device info
  test_assert: Trigger ticos assert
  test_busfault: Trigger a busfault
  test_hardfault: Trigger a hardfault
  test_memmanage: Trigger a memory management fault
  test_usagefault: Trigger a usage fault
  test_log: Writes test logs to log buffer
  test_log_capture: Trigger capture of current log buffer contents
  test_reboot: Force system reset and track it with a trace event
  test_trace: Capture an example trace event
  help: Lists all commands
  ```

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.31.5 and SDK 0.31.4 - July 22, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr port: enable proper backtraces for Zephyr `__ASSERT()` macro on
  aarch32/cortex_m. Prior to this fix, crashes from `__ASSERT()` triggering
  would show an incorrect PC/LR for the active thread.

- Support for pre-release nRF Connect SDK v2.0.99 and Zephyr > v3.1:
  - Upcoming nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr releases removed logging v1. Add build
    support for these changes, and keep backwards compatibility for previous nRF
    Connect SDK/Zephyr releases
  - Correct an issue in the Ticos logging v2 backend, when the system was
    invoked from an ISR context. This could happen due to a recent change, in
    Ticos SDK v0.31.1, where the Zephyr fatal informational logs were output
    from `ticos_platform_reboot()` by default. It did not impact the
    collected backtrace, but it would show a nuisance `__ASSERT()` in the
    console output, if `CONFIG_ASSERT=y`.

#### :house: Internal

- Fix a compilation issue in the Dialog example app from the removal of
  `ticos_demo_cli_cmd_print_chunk()` in Ticos SDK release v0.31.4.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.31.4 and SDK 0.31.3 - July 19, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- ESP32 port: add new Kconfig option, `CONFIG_TICOS_AUTOMATIC_INIT`, that can
  be explicitly set to `n` to skip automatically initializing the Ticos SDK
  on boot. This can be useful if Ticos SDK initialization needs to be
  deferred to application start.

- Zephyr port: add Kconfig options,
  `CONFIG_TICOS_INIT_PRIORITY`/`CONFIG_TICOS_INIT_LEVEL_POST_KERNEL` for
  controlling the Ticos SDK initialization level and priority. This can be
  useful when needing Ticos to initialize earlier in the system startup
  sequence, for example for diagnosing crashes in an early driver
  initialization.

- Partial support, still in progress, for NRF Connect SDK + Zephyr v3.1:
  - Remove reference to the now-removed Kconfig symbol,
    `NET_SOCKETS_OFFLOAD_TLS` to enable building without warnings. **NOTE:** if
    mbedtls is enabled (`CONFIG_MBEDTLS=y`), but is _not_ being used for HTTP
    transfers (eg, mbedtls is used for security functions, but the device does
    not use HTTP for transferring data), it may be necessary to explicitly set
    `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_USES_MBEDTLS=n`.

#### :house: Internal

- Zephyr port: remove an unused header file,
  `ports/zephyr/common/ticos_zephyr_http.h`

- Remove `ticos_demo_cli_cmd_print_chunk()` demo function.
  `ticos_data_export_dump_chunks()` can be used instead, which is intended to
  be used with the "Chunks Debug" UI in the Ticos web application- see
  [here](https://ticos.io/chunk-data-export) for more details

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.31.3 and SDK 0.31.2 - July 8, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Support Zephyr v3.1+ by conditionally compiling out Logger v1 code, thanks to
  @tejlmand for the patch!

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.31.2 and SDK 0.31.1 - June 24, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fixed a :bug: in the
  [Zephyr port HTTP implementation](ports/zephyr/common/ticos_platform_http.c),
  where a socket file descriptor was leaked. This caused every HTTP operation
  after the first to fail on Zephyr platforms. Thanks to @rerickson1 for the
  fix!
- Added an update to improve the quality of stack traces when using
  `TICOS_ASSERT` with the TI ARM Clang Compiler

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.31.1 and SDK 0.31.0 - June 16, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Enable the Zephyr fault handler (including console fault prints) after
  Ticos handler runs. Can be disabled by implementing
  `ticos_platform_reboot()`. See details in
  [ports/zephyr/include/ticos/ports/zephyr/coredump.h](ports/zephyr/include/ticos/ports/zephyr/coredump.h)

#### :house: Internal

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.30.3 and SDK 0.30.2 - April 25, 2022

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Particle's Device OS port improvements:
  - A user initiated reboot will now be recorded as a User Shutdown instead of a
    Low Power reset
  - A custom hardware_version can now be specified using the `hardware_version`
    argument when initializing the Ticos library
  - Default hardware version now uses the `PLATFORM_NAME` macro instead of
    `PRODUCT_SERIES` macro
- Zephyr port improvements
  - Exposed lower level APIs to Ticos's HTTP post implementation to allow
    easier custom handling. See
    [`ports/zephyr/include/ticos/ports/zephyr/http.h`](ports/zephyr/include/ticos/ports/zephyr/http.h)

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fix stack selection when in ISR context in some Zephyr versions
- Fix a build error when building Zephyr with `CONFIG_NORDIC_SECURITY_BACKEND`
  enabled. New Kconfig flag `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_USES_MBEDTLS` can be used to
  manually control this configuration if necessary (default should be set
  correctly in most cases)

#### :house: Internal

- Fix CI unit test build error from older version of gcc

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.30.0 and SDK 0.29.1 - Mar 31, 2022

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added a Task Watchdog optional module. This can be used to monitor and trigger
  a fault in the case of a task or thread that becomes stuck. See information in
  [components/include/ticos/core/task_watchdog.h](components/include/ticos/core/task_watchdog.h)
  for how to configure and use the module

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

  `CONFIG_ARM_MPU` flag enabled
- Fix compilation errors to enable compatibility with Zephyr v3.0.0

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.29.1 and SDK 0.29.0 - Mar 16, 2022

#### :house: Internal

- Updated Ticos Diagnostic GATT Service (MDS) based on feedback. This service
  can be used to transparently forward data collected by the SDK to a Bluetooth
  Low Energy gateway and proxied to the cloud. See
  [ports/include/ticos/ports/ble/mds.h](ports/include/ticos/ports/ble/mds.h#L1)
- Updated Mbed OS invoke commands to be more resilient against python package
  conflicts

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If your project is based on Zephyr < 2.6, you now need to explicitly set
  `CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT=y` in your `prj.conf`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.29.0 and SDK 0.28.2 - Feb 28, 2022

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added a port to Particle's Device OS. More details can be found in
  [`ports/particle/README.md`](ports/particle/README.md).

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Add an optional override flag to control the name used for Zephyr data
  regions- see
  [`ports/zephyr/common/ticos_zephyr_ram_regions.c`](ports/zephyr/common/ticos_zephyr_ram_regions.c).
  Only needed for unusual Zephyr + Ticos configurations prior to Zephyr v2.7
  (for example, nRF Connect SDK v1.7.1 with Ticos SDK v0.27.3+)
- Fix the STM32F7xx reboot reason port to correctly account for the internally
  wired Pin Reset
- Fix a function prototype mismatch in the STM32L4 flash port (thanks to
  @schultetwin for reporting this in #22!)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.28.0 and SDK 0.27.3 - Jan 4, 2022

#### :rocket: New Features

- Add support for setting string metrics, see
  `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_set_string()` in
  [`components/include/ticos/metrics/metrics.h`](components/include/ticos/metrics/metrics.h)
  for the new API. See the [Ticos Docs](https://ticos.io/embedded-metrics) for
  general information on using the metrics API.
- Updated `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_debug_print()` to also print current timer
  values, instead of showing `0`. See
  [`components/include/ticos/metrics/metrics.h`](components/include/ticos/metrics/metrics.h)
  for details

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Update the STM32 QP/C example ([`examples/qp`](examples/qp)) to compile and
  run correctly now
- Add intructions for exercising Ticos OTA in the ESP32 example, see the
  "Testing OTA" section in
  [`examples/esp32/README.md`](examples/esp32/README.md)
- Update the Ticos HTTP client to URL-encode query params when checking for
  OTA updates (in the case of Device properties containing reserved characters,
  eg `+`). Update the ESP port to check for reserved characters in query params
  and emit an error
- Fix an outdated comment in `cmake/Ticos.cmake`, as reported in
  [issue #21](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/issues/21)
  (thank you @C47D !)

#### :house: Internal

- Update Python tests to use a mocked-out gdb instance

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.27.3 and SDK 0.27.2 - Nov 22, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fix a build error for the Nordic Connect SDK v1.7.99 development version
- Correct an error in header file include order in the Mynewt port
- Update the esp32 and zephyr examples to use `1.0.0-dev` instead of
  `1.0.0+<6 digits of build id>` for the version specifier. Build id is no
  longer required for symbol file reconciliation and the `+` character is a
  reserved character for URI schemes; this impacted OTA release requests. See
  this document for
  [Ticos's recommended versioning strategy](https://docs.ticos.com/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version/#software-version)
- Add a reboot reason port for the STM32F7xx family.

#### :house: Internal

- Re-run python `black` and `isort` formatters on python code

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.27.2 and SDK 0.27.1 - Nov 5, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- The Mynewt integration now supports the Ticos demo shell via
  `tcs_shell_init()`, see the [Mynewt port README.md](ports/mynewt/README.md)
  for details. Huge thanks to @t3zeng for providing this implementation!
- Add support for ESP-IDF v4.3.1. This update should fix the bootlooping issue
  seen when using the port with v4.3.1+ of ESP-IDF.
- Add support for `LOG2` deferred mode on zephyr. This should fix bootloops when
  enabling `LOG2`.
- Fix flipped args passed from `TICOS_ASSERT_RECORD()` to
  `TICOS_ASSERT_EXTRA_AND_REASON()` (regression in v0.23.0). This affected
  the `_extra` additional context value passed via this macro.
- Fix a typo in
  [`ports/esp_idf/ticos/common/ticos_platform_http_client.c`](ports/esp_idf/ticos/common/ticos_platform_http_client.c)
  which caused the OTA example to always return "OTA Update Available" when the
  current version is already the latest.

#### :house: Internal

- Updated list of sample apps in (`examples/README.md`)[examples/README.md]

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.27.1 and SDK 0.27.0 - Oct 11, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Extended mynewt RTOS port to capture coredumps via a
  [`os_coredump_cb`](ports/mynewt/src/ticos_platform_port.c) implementation
  when `TICOS_COREDUMP_CB=1`

#### :house: Internal

- Fixed a few compiler warnings emitted when compiling with clang
- Improved documentation for
  [coredump config with nRF5 SDK](ports/nrf5_sdk/nrf5_coredump_regions.c)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.27.0 and SDK 0.26.1 - Oct 5, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added support for using [compact logs](https://ticos.io/compact-logs) with the
  Ticos [log subsystem](https://ticos.io/logging).
- Added port for mynewt RTOS to Ticos SDK. (Huge thanks to @t3zeng for the
  help here!) See
  [sdk/embedded/ports/mynewt](sdk/embedded/ports/mynewt/README.md) for more
  details.
- Added support for
  [Zephyr 2.7](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/releases/release-notes-2.7.html)
  release.

#### :house: Internal

- Fixed a missing symbol linker error for `ticos_fault_handler` that could
  arise when compiling with `-flto`.
- Fixed a compiler error in `ticos_fault_handling_arm.c` that arose when
  using certain versions of the Clang compiler.
- Cleaned up python scripts after enabling additional PEP8 naming convention
  linters.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.26.1 and SDK 0.26.0 - Sept 20, 2021

#### :house: Internal

- Updated
  [`modem_key_mgmt_exists`](ports/zephyr/ncs/src/ticos_nrf91_root_cert_storage.c)
  API usage to be compatible with changes upcomming in nRF Connect SDK 1.8.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.26.0 and SDK 0.25.0 - Sept 15, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added preview of the Ticos Diagnostic GATT Service (MDS). This service can
  be used to transparently forward data collected by the SDK to a Bluetooth Low
  Energy gateway and proxied to the cloud. See
  [ports/include/ticos/ports/ble/mds.h](ports/include/ticos/ports/ble/mds.h#L1)
  for more details!
  - Added reference port of MDS for the DA1469x SDK to
    [ports/dialog/da1469x/ticos_diagnostic_service.c](ports/dialog/da1469x/ticos_diagnostic_service.c#L1)
- Implemented [utility python script](scripts/eclipse_patch.py#L1) which can be
  used for quickly adding a `ticos-firmware-sdk` port to an eclipse project.
  For more details, run

  ```bash
  python scripts/eclipse_patch.py --help
  ```

- Added example project demonstrating integration of Ticos on Cypress'
  [CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-64-standard-secure-aws-wi-fi-bt-pioneer-kit-cy8ckit)
  running [Amazon-FreeRTOS](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos) publishing
  data using an
  [AWS IoT MQTT broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/getting_started_cypress_psoc64.html).
  For more details about how to run the Ticos example, see
  [examples/cypress/CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W/README.md](examples/cypress/CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W/README.md).
- Fixed a compiler warning emitted when using TI's GCC Compiler as reported by
  @albertskog in
  [issue #18](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/issues/18)

#### :house: Internal

- Apply some suggestions emitted by `flake8-pytest-style` linter to
  [scripts/tests/test_ticos_gdb.py](scripts/tests/test_ticos_gdb.py).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.25.0 and SDK 0.24.2 - August 30, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a workaround to
  [`event_storage.h`](components/include/ticos/core/event_storage.h) to
  prevent compilation errors when using
  [the unity test framework](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) to generate
  mocks.
- Updated [`makefiles/TicosWorker.mk`](makefiles/TicosWorker.mk) to use
  `sort` to guarantee a deterministic file list order irrespestive of
  [make version](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?52076). A consistent
  order is useful for
  [reproducible builds](https://ticos.io/reproducible-builds).
- Make use of `__has_include()` in Zephy port to remove the requirement of
  always needing to create`ticos_platform_config.h`,
  `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_config.def`, &
  `ticos_trace_reason_user_config.def` for a build to compile. To force a
  compile failure instead when any of these files do not exist, a user can set
  [`CONFIG_TICOS_USER_CONFIG_SILENT_FAIL=n`](ports/zephyr/Kconfig)

#### :house: Internal

- The current version of the Ticos Firmware SDK can now be accessed
  programmatically from the
  [`ticos/version.h`](components/include/ticos/version.h).
- Improved HTTP util parser when dealing with malformed status codes
- Updated
  [nRF91 sample test app](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160/ticos_demo_app) to
  be compatible with nRF Connect SDK 1.6

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.24.2 and SDK 0.24.1 - August 17, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a new utility API, `ticos_packetizer_set_active_sources`, to the
  [data_packetizer](components/include/ticos/core/data_packetizer.h) module,
  which let's one control the exact data sources that will get packetized. See
  description in the header for more details
- Port Improvements:
  - NXP i.MX RT102x
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from SRC_SRSR register](ports/nxp/rt1021/src_reboot_tracking.c)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.24.1 and SDK 0.24.0 - August 9, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Applied suggestions from @elliot-wdtl for the Zephyr ports
  ([#15](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/pull/15)):
  - Updated software watchdog port to make use of `TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG`
    macro
- Applied suggestions from @ioannisg & @mbolivar-nordic in
  ([#14](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/pull/14)) to change
  the KConfig options used to select `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_ENABLE` &
  `CONFIG_TICOS_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_NRF9160_MODEM` &
  `CONFIG_TICOS_NRF_CONNECT_SDK` when using nRF91 targets.

#### :house: Internal

- Added `export` command to the demo cli to better mirror
  [our suggested integration test commands](https://ticos.io/mcu-test-commands)

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are were using a custom nRF91 based board config (i.e neither
  `BOARD_NRF9160DK_NRF9160NS` or `BOARD_THINGY91_NRF9160NS`), the following
  KConfig options will now be enabled by default. The following can be added to
  your `prj.conf` to restore the original behavior:
  - `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_ENABLE=n`
  - `CONFIG_TICOS_NRF_CONNECT_SDK=n`
  - `CONFIG_TICOS_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_TLS_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE=y`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.24.0 and SDK 0.23.0 - July 27, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added "compact log" support to trace events. When enabled, the format string
  will be removed at compile time from calls to `TICOS_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG`
  and an integer along with arguments will be serialized instead. The actual
  string will recovered and formatted when it arrives in the Ticos cloud.
  This leads to a massive reduction in space & bandwidth needed to send trace
  events. For more details about how to set up,
  [check out this guide!](https://ticos.io/compact-logs)
- Fixed a `-Wshadow` compiler error that would arise in
  [`ticos_coredump_regions_armv7.c`](components/panics/src/ticos_coredump_regions_armv7.c)
  when `TICOS_COLLECT_MPU_STATE` was enabled
- Updated debug print utility in
  [`ticos_coredump_storage_debug.c`](components/panics/src/ticos_coredump_storage_debug.c)
  to guard against potentially printing an uninitialized string.
- Removed unnecessary extra argument from `TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG`

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were already using `TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG`, you will need to
  update your call site invocations to remove the argument being passed. i.e

```diff
-      TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG(0);
+      TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG();
```

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.23.0 and SDK 0.22.0 - July 8, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Support for Dialog DA1469x chip family (Huge thanks to @iandmorris for the
  help here!)
  - Example eclipse project and more details about how to add the port to any
    DA1469x based project [can be found here](examples/dialog/da1469x).
- Added a simple utility to track heap allocations. This can be used to more
  easily debug what allocations led to out of memory situations with the
  addition of only several hundred bytes to a coredump capture. For more
  details, see
  [`ticos/core/heap_stats.h`](components/include/ticos/core/heap_stats.h)
  - For FreeRTOS users, automatic tracking of heap allocations can be enabled
    with the Ticos port. To enable, see the "Heap Tracking" section in the
    README at [ports/freertos/](ports/freertos).
- Added new convenience utilities for asserting when a watchdog event is
  detected,
  [`TICOS_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG`](components/include/ticos/panics/assert.h#L65).
  This will result in the issue in the Ticos UI being classified for as a
  "Software Watchdog" instead of an "Assert" for easier classification.
- Fixed a :bug: in
  [Zephyr port](ports/zephyr/common/ticos_platform_metrics.c) where cpu
  runtime metrics were never getting reset after a heartbeat was collected
  leading to always increasing runtime values getting reported.

#### :house: Internal

- Improved support for running [tests](tests/) against different versions of
  clang and gcc and enabled more address sanitizers such as
  [`-fsanitize=undefined`](https://interrupt.ticos.com/blog/ubsan-trap)
- Misc documentation edits

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.22.0 and SDK 0.21.1 - June 17, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Reduced code space utilized by metric subsystem by transitioning from a string
  representation of metric names to an enum representation.
- Updated [`ticos_gdb.py`](scripts/ticos_gdb.py) helper script to use
  latest Ticos API for uploading symbol files.
- Removed "DST Root CA X3" from the required Ticos
  [root certificate list](components/include/ticos/http/root_certs.h) as
  there is no infrastructure that relies on it anymore.
- Updated PEM representation of all root certificates to include newlines after
  64-character intervals to improve portability with various TLS stacks.

#### :house: Internal

- Updated [`fw_build_id.py`](scripts/fw_build_id.py) script. The same script can
  now also be installed via [`pypi`](https://pypi.org/project/tcs-build-id/):
  `pip install tcs_build_id`
- Various improvements to example app documentation

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.21.1 and SDK 0.21.0 - June 9, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr / nRF Connect SDK port:
  - Made periodic upload a named choice,
    `TICOS_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_CONTEXT`, so the default can be overriden
    from other Kconfig files.
  - Added prompt text for `TICOS_HTTP_DEDICATED_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.21.0 and SDK 0.20.2 - June 8, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr / nRF Connect SDK port:
  - `CONFIG_TICOS_NRF_CONNECT_SDK` is now only enabled by default when
    `CONFIG_TICOS=y`
  - `CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO=y` is now selected by default (in prep for
    deprecation of `CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT`)
  - Added new option (`CONFIG_TICOS_USER_CONFIG_ENABLE=y`) which can be used
    to remove requirement of providing any user specific configuration.
  - Added two choices for periodic posting of ticos data:
    - `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_USE_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE`. This is the
      default and matches previous release behavior of posting data to Ticos
      from the system work queue
    - `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_USE_DEDICATED_WORKQUEUE` This is a
      new option which can be used to post data from a dedicated worker queue.
      This can be useful if the network stack may block for extended periods of
      time which would stall other system work queue jobs from getting
      processed.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- The Zephyr & nRF Connect SDK ports will now only enable the `TICOS_SHELL`
  by default when the Zephyr shell is enabled. `CONFIG_SHELL=y` must now be
  enabled explicitly in your `prj.conf` for the Ticos Shell to be enabled.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.20.2 and SDK 0.20.1 - June 4, 2021

#### :house: Internal

- Updated `sTicosBuildIdStorage` structure to track the build id length used
  for event serialization and updated [`fw_build_id.py`](scripts/fw_build_id.py)
  script to extract information.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.20.1 and SDK 0.20.0 - May 28, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Zephyr / nRF Connect SDK port:
  - Replaced `TICOS_DEFAULT_REBOOT_REASON_IMPL` Kconfig option with
    `TICOS_REBOOT_REASON_GET_CUSTOM` and updated default configuration for
    the nRF Connect SDK. This fixes an issue resulting in the
    [generic ticos_reboot_reason_get](ports/zephyr/common/ticos_platform_core.c#L53)
    getting linked rather than the
    [nRF Connect SDK port](ports/zephyr/ncs/src/nrfx_pmu_reboot_tracking.c#L139).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.20.0 and SDK 0.19.0 - May 27, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Updated
  [ticos_fault_handling_arm.c](components/panics/src/ticos_fault_handling_arm.c)
  to work around a compiler bug when using 6.x of the GNU ARM Toolchain
- Port Improvements:
  - SAML10/SAML11
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCAUSE register](ports/atmel/saml1x/rcause_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
  - Updated [esp-idf port](ports/esp_idf) to streamline integrations making use
    of the [amazon-freertos](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)
  - Zephyr
    - Added several Kconfig options for better control over information
      collected in a coredump:
      - `CONFIG_TICOS_COREDUMP_COLLECT_DATA_REGIONS` to enable/disable
        collection of `.data` region
      - `CONFIG_TICOS_COREDUMP_COLLECT_BSS_REGIONS` to enable/disable
        collection of `.bss` region
      - `CONFIG_TICOS_COREDUMP_STORAGE_CUSTOM=y` can be used to opt out of
        the default RAM backed coredump implementation and provide a custom one
        in the port.
- Reduced instruction cycles required to update a
  [heartbeat metric](metrics/src/ticos_metrics.c)
- Events will now store an abbreviated build id when serialized

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.19.0 and SDK 0.18.0 - May 19, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added support for collecting additional register information when a Hardfault
  takes place when using the Zephyr port. This information will be decoded and
  displayed in the Ticos UI in the "Exceptions" tab.

- Updated
  [`buffered_coredump_storage.h` ](ports/include/ticos/ports/buffered_coredump_storage.h)
  to use `memmov` instead of `memcpy` since `dst` and `src` buffers may overlap
  when all of `.bss` is saved in a coredump capture.
- Added a new Kconfig option to the Zephyr port,
  `CONFIG_TICOS_METRICS_EXTRA_DEFS_FILE=y`, which causes
  `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_extra.def` to be included in the metric
  definitions. This can be utilized by a third party consumer of Zephyr to more
  easily extend the default heartbeat metrics collected when using ticos.

#### :house: Internal

- Updated [`ticos_gdb.py`](scripts/ticos_gdb.py) helper script to use
  latest Ticos API for uploading symbol files.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are using [nRF Connect SDK / Zephyr port](ports/zephyr/ncs/), the SDK
  will now automatically be picked up as a Zephyr Module! You will need to make
  two changes:
  1. Remove the `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES` addition from your projects
     CMakeLists.txt, i.e
  ```diff
  --- a/your_application/CMakeLists.txt
  +++ b/your_application/CMakeLists.txt
  @@ -3,7 +3,6 @@
  - list(APPEND ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE}/../modules/ticos-firmware-sdk/ports/nrf-connect-sdk)
  ```
  2. Add `CONFIG_TICOS_NRF_CONNECT_SDK=y` to your projects `prj.conf`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.18.0 and SDK 0.17.1 - May 14, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Support for Dialog DA145xx chip family (Huge thanks to @iandmorris for the
  help here!)
  - GCC & Keil based demo application for the DA14531 & DA14585/DA14586
    [can be found here](examples/dialog/da145xx).
  - Ports for applications using the DA145xx SDK
    [can be found here](ports/dialog/da145xx).
- ESP32 port improvements
  - Added example of periodically posting data to ticos via a background
    task.
  - Added a new Kconfig option, `TICOS_COREDUMP_USE_OTA_SLOT=y` which can be
    used to save a coredump in an unused OTA slot rather than the default
    coredump partition. This can be useful in situations where Ticos is being
    integrated after a product has shipped and updating the partition table is
    no longer possible.
- Added `TICOS_EVENT_STORAGE_NV_SUPPORT_ENABLED=0` which can be used to
  disable dynamic configuration of non-volatile storage. Setting this flag when
  the non-volatile event storage API is not in use will save several hundred
  bytes of codespace.
- Hardened
  [ticos_http_parse_response()](components/http/src/ticos_http_utils.c)
  utility to parse HTTP responses with headers that exceed a length of 128 bytes
- Fixed a :bug: in`ticos_log_save_preformatted()` leading to invalid logs
  being reported when attempting to save log lines > 128 bytes. (thanks @alvarop
  for the report!)
- Added a convenience API,
  [`ticos_create_unique_version_string()`](components/include/ticos/core/platform/device_info.h),
  which can be used for easily appending a build id on the software version
  reported.

#### :house: Internal

- Updates to demo cli:
  - `TICOS_DEMO_SHELL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE` can be used to shrink the maximum
    amount of bytes that can be buffered on a single line.
  - Made `ticos_demo_shell_commands.h` public and moved it to
    [`ticos/demo/shell_commands.h`](components/include/ticos/demo/shell_commands.h)
    to facilitate easier overriding of the default set of commands used in a
    build.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.17.1 and SDK 0.17.0 - April 30, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- ESP32 Example App Updates:
  - Added `export` command to demonstrate how data can be dumped via the console
  - Added
    [Ticos Build ID](examples/esp32/apps/ticos_demo_app/CMakeLists.txt) to
    example app as a reference
- Fixed a :bug: in
  [`ticos_platform_sanitize_address_range()`](ports/templates/ticos_platform_port.c)
  template example.
- Refactored nRF5 example app to mirror integration steps listed in the
  [latest integration guide](https://ticos.io/cortex-m-getting-started)
- Added a new configuration option, `TICOS_PLATFORM_FAULT_HANDLER_CUSTOM`,
  which can be used to explicitly disable the stub
  [`ticos_platform_fault_handler()` implementation](components/panics/src/ticos_fault_handling_arm.c)
- Improve the quality of backtrace recovery for asserts when using Arm Compiler
  5 by removing use of noreturn function attribute for
  `ticos_fault_handling_assert()` declaration.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.17.0 and SDK 0.16.1 - April 26, 2021

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added support for collecting ARMv7-M MPU regions as part of coredump
  collection. To enable, set
  [`TICOS_COLLECT_MPU_STATE=1`](components/include/ticos/default_config.h#L1)
  in your `ticos_platform_config.h`. Once enabled, the MPU will be
  automatically analyzed for configuration errors and results will be presented
  in the "MPU" tab in the Ticos UI for a coredump.
- Added a new API,
  [`ticos_log_trigger_collection`](components/include/ticos/core/log.h#L143),
  which can be used to "freeze" the current contents of the log buffer when
  unexpected behavior takes place on the device for upload to Ticos. The logs
  can then be [uploaded to Ticos](https://ticos.io/data-to-cloud) just like
  any other data and appear in the UI for a device. For more details about the
  Ticos log subsystem see https://ticos.io/logging

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fixed compilation error when compiling the panics component against Cortex-M0+
  with ARM Compiler 5
- Added several
  [default heartbeat metrics to the Zephyr port](ports/zephyr/config/ticos_metrics_heartbeat_zephyr_port_config.def)
  around timer task stack usage and execution time.

#### :house: Internal

- Refreshed esp32 example app README and updated instructions for the v3.3.5
  esp-idf
- Added `test_log` & `trigger_logs` CLI commands to nRF5 & Zephyr example
  applications to exercise new log collection functionality.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.16.1 and SDK 0.16.0 - April 12, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fixed a :bug: in Zephyr port leading to a compilation error with nRF Connect
  SDK when `CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_CLIENT=y` & `CONFIG_TICOS_NRF_SHELL=y`
- Dialog DA1468x
  [QSPI coredump storage port](ports/dialog/da1468x/qspi_coredump_storage.c#L1)
  updates:
  - default storage parition (`NVMS_LOG_PART`) can be overridden
    `TICOS_PLATFORM_COREDUMP_STORAGE_PARTITION`
  - Max space used within partition can be limited using
    `TICOS_PLATFORM_COREDUMP_STORAGE_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`
- Updated [zephyr example application](examples/zephyr/README.md) and docs to be
  compatible with v2.5 release.

#### :house: Internal

- Added `ticos_log_save` stub to unit tests to facilitate easier testing of
  logging dependencies
- Improved correctness of strategy used to capture `msp` & `psp` register in
  Cortex-M fault handler.
- Added new convenience utility,
  `ticos_circular_buffer_read_with_callback()`, to
  [circular buffer api](components/include/ticos/util/circular_buffer.h).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.16.0 and SDK 0.15.0 - April 8, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added new convenience APIs, `ticos_event_storage_bytes_used()` &
  `ticos_event_storage_bytes_free()`, to
  [event storage module](components/include/ticos/core/event_storage.h#L1).
- Added a new configuration option,
  [`TICOS_ASSERT_HALT_IF_DEBUGGING_ENABLED`](components/include/ticos/default_config.h#L1).
  By default, it is off, but when enabled will cause
  `ticos_platform_halt_if_debugging()` to be called prior to triggering the
  full coredump capture.
- Fixed a type conversion compiler warning emitted by IAR and ARMCC in
  [`resetreas_reboot_tracking.c`](ports/nrf5_sdk/resetreas_reboot_tracking.c#L1).
- Port Updates:
  - Dialog DA1468x
    - [QSPI coredump storage port](ports/dialog/da1468x/qspi_coredump_storage.c#L1)
    - [Added `ticos_platform_reboot_tracking_boot()` implementation](ports/dialog/da1468x/reset_stat_reboot_tracking.c)

#### :house: Internal

- Removed "Heartbeat triggered!" print when
  `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_debug_trigger()` is called

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were using
  [`ports/dialog/da1468x/reset_stat_reboot_tracking.c`](ports/dialog/da1468x/reset_stat_reboot_tracking.c),
  the `ticos_platform_reboot_tracking_boot()` implementation from your
  `ticos_platform_port.c` file can be removed and the one in the port can be
  picked up.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.15.0 and SDK 0.14.0 - March 24, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a new convenience API,
  [`ticos_device_info_dump()`](components/include/ticos/core/device_info.h#L1)
  which can be used to pretty print the device information populated in the
  `ticos_platform_get_device_info()` dependency function.
- Added
  [`ticos_platform_sanitize_address_range()`](components/include/ticos/panics/platform/coredump.h#L95).
  This functrions is intended for use in your
  `ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions()` implementation when capturing
  regions that are not defined at compile time.
- Fixed a :bug: with `ticos_coredump_storage_debug_test_*` which would
  generate a false positive test failure when the coredump storage area was not
  divisible by 16.
- C++ header guards are now included in all headers in the ports/ directory for
  easier integration in mixed C/C++ environments
- Port Updates:
  - Dialog DA1468x: Added patch which can be used to add
    [GNU Build ID](ports/dialog/da1468x/gnu-build-id.patch#L1)
  - Added support for FreeRTOS 8 to the [FreeRTOS port](ports/freertos/).
  - STM32H7 family / STM32CubeH7:
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCC RSR register](ports/stm32cube/h7/rcc_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
  - STM32WBxx family / STM32CubeWB:
    - [internal flash coredump storage](ports/stm32cube/wb/flash_coredump_storage.c#L1)
  - Improved configurability of
    [RAM backed coredump storage port](ports/panics/src/ticos_platform_ram_backed_coredump.c#L1)
    with new configuration options for to control where RAM is allocated, what
    memory regions are collected, and stack size to collect.
- Added additional comments to [`ports/templates`](ports/templates) directory to
  facilitate porting.

#### :house: Internal

- [Demo CLI Shell commands](components/demo/src/ticos_demo_shell_commands.c#L50)
  are now defined as weak symbols so they can be overriden with a custom set.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were using the
  [`ports/emlib/msc_coredump_storage.c`](ports/emlib/msc_coredump_storage.c)
  port in your system, you must add
  `TICOS_PLATFORM_COREDUMP_STORAGE_USE_FLASH=1` to your
  `ticos_platform_config.h`
- If you were using `ports/panics/src/ticos_platform_ram_backed_coredump.c`:
  - [`ticos_platform_sanitize_address_range()`](components/include/ticos/panics/platform/coredump.h)
    must be implemented.
  - The default coredump storage RAM size was changed from 700 to 1024 bytes so
    more information can be captured. The original size can be restored by
    setting `TICOS_PLATFORM_COREDUMP_STORAGE_RAM_SIZE 700` in your
    `ticos_platform_config.h`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.14.0 and SDK 0.13.1 - March 18, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Renamed `platforms` folder to [`examples`](examples/) to better capture that
  the folder contains "example" integrations of the Ticos SDK into hello
  world style apps from various SDKs
- Port Updates:
  - Zephyr: added a
    [software watchdog port](ports/zephyr/common/ticos_software_watchdog.c#L1)
    which can be used for capturing coredumps ahead of a hardware watchdog
    reset.
  - EFR32:
    [rich reboot reason info derived from EMU_RSTCAUSE register](ports/emlib/rmu_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
- Updated [nRF9160 Demo Application](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160) to be
  compatible with
  [nRF Connect SDK 1.5](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/v1.5-branch)
- Added support for capturing coredumps with GDB from GNU GCC 4.9 to
  [`ticos_gdb.py`](scripts/ticos_gdb.py)

#### :house: Internal

- Added support for automatically capturing logs with Zephyr when logging in
  synchronous mode `CONFIG_LOG_IMMEDIATE=y`
- Unified nomenclature for references to the "Project Key" used to push data to
  Ticos

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

If you were linking any files from the `platforms` folder into your project, the
path needs to be updated to `examples`:

```diff
- ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/platforms/
+ ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/examples/
```

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.13.1 and SDK 0.13.0 - March 10, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Reference platform API implementations for DA1468x:
  - [rich reboot reason info derived from RESET_STAT_REG register](ports/dialog/da1468x/reset_stat_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
- Fixed a :bug: that led to a unit test failure in `test_coredump_storage_debug`
  in some environments where `const` arrays were getting dynamically built on
  the stack at runtime.
- Worked around a limitation in GNU GCC 4.9's extended ASM to fix a compiler bug
  that would arise when compiling `ticos_fault_handling_arm.c` for Cortex-M0
  targets.
- Added a new [`ports/templates`](ports/templates) folder that can be
  copy/pasted into a project and used as a starting point for a Ticos port!

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.13.0 and SDK 0.12.0 - March 4, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Improved documentation in [README](README.md) and [components](components/)
  directories.
- Added coredump capture support to panics component for the AARCH64
  architecture.
- Reference platform API implementations for the following MCUs/SDKs:
  - STM32WBxx family / STM32CubeWB:
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCC CSR register](ports/stm32cube/wb/rcc_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
  - nRF5 SDK
    - [app_timer based port for metric dependencies](ports/nrf5_sdk/ticos_platform_metrics.c#L1)
- [`fw_build_id.py`](scripts/fw_build_id.py) script improvements
  - script is now compatible with Python2 environments.
  - Added new `--dump <chars>` option to simplify extraction of build id in
    automation, i.e:
    ```
     python scripts/fw_build_id.py <ELF> --dump 7
     3a3e81f
    ```

#### :house: Internal

- Started work to enable automatic capture of logs in a coredump for the Zephyr
  & nRF Connect SDK.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were linking `ticos_nrf5_coredump.c` in your project:
  - the file has been split into `nrf5_coredump_regions.c` (which defines the
    regions to collect in a coredump) & `nrf5_coredump_storage.c` (which
    implements the port for saving coredumps to internal flash). Both of these
    files must be added to your build system.
  - Linker script names for region to save coredump to and regions to collect
    need to be updated:
    - Update`__CoreStart` & `__TicosCoreStorageEnd` to
      `__TicosCoreStorageStart` & `__TicosCoreStorageEnd` in linker
      script.
    - Update `__MfltCoredumpRamStart` & `__MfltCoredumpRamEnd` to
      `__TicosCoredumpRamStart` & `__TicosCoredumpRamEnd`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.12.0 and SDK 0.11.4 - Feb 14, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- The SDK now includes a central configuration header at
  [`components/include/ticos/config.h`](components/include/ticos/config.h#L1).
  Platform overrides can be defined in `ticos_platform_config.h`
- Reference platform API implementations for the
  [nRF5 SDK](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/struct_sdk/struct/sdk_nrf5_latest.html)
  - [rich reboot reason info derived from RESETREAS register](ports/nrf5_sdk/resetreas_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
  - [internal flash coredump storage](ports/nrf5_sdk/ticos_nrf5_coredump.c#L1)
- All headers for Ticos "components" can now be found under
  [`components/include/ticos/`](components/include/ticos/). This
  simplifies adding components to build systems as only a single path is now
  needed!

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- You must create the file `ticos_platform_config.h` and add it to your
  include path. This file can be used in place of compiler defines to tune the
  SDK configurations settings.
- If you are not using a Ticos
  [build system helper](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system)
  1. Remove all include paths at
     `${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/components/${COMPONENT}/include`
  2. Add include path `${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/components/include` to your
     build system
- If you were linking any of the nRF5 example app files in your project, the
  directory has changed:

```diff
- ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/nrf5/libraries/ticos/platform_reference_impl/ticos_platform_reboot_tracking.c
+ ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/nrf5_sdk/resetreas_reboot_tracking.c
- ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/nrf5/libraries/ticos/platform_reference_impl/ticos_platform_coredump.c
+ ${TICOS_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/nrf5_sdk/ticos_nrf5_coredump.c
```

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.11.4 and SDK 0.11.3 - Feb 4, 2021

- ESP8266 Updates
  - Added new Kconfig option which can be set via `make menuconfig` and be used
    to disable the Ticos integration, `CONFIG_TICOS=n`.
  - Fixed a :bug: leading to a compilation error when
    both`CONFIG_USING_ESP_CONSOLE=n` and `CONFIG_TICOS_CLI_ENABLED=n`
- Added default implementations for `TICOS_GET_LR()`, `TICOS_GET_PC()`,
  and `TICOS_BREAKPOINT()` to
  [`compiler_gcc.h`](components/include/ticos/core/compiler_gcc.h) to
  facilitate compilations of the SDK against other architectures.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.11.3 and SDK 0.11.2 - Jan 31, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Reference platform API implementations for the following MCUs/SDKs:
  - nRF Connect SDK
    - Added support for nRF Connect SDK v1.3.x
    - Added support for FOTA with Ticos. See
      [`ticos_fota_start()`](ports/nrf-connect-sdk/zephyr/include/ticos/nrfconnect_port/fota.h)
      for more details
  - Zephyr
    - Added implementations for `ticos_platform_metrics_timer_boot()` &
      `ticos_platform_get_time_since_boot_ms()` ticos dependencies to
      Zephyr port. A custom implementation can still be provided by
      setting`TICOS_METRICS_TIMER_CUSTOM=y`
    - Metrics support is now enabled by default when `CONFIG_TICOS=y` and can
      be disabled by setting `CONFIG_TICOS_METRICS=n`
    - Added support for periodically uploading Ticos data in the background.
      This is off by default and can be enabled with the
      `CONFIG_TICOS_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=y` option
- Fixed a :bug: that could lead to an invalid coredump being sent to Ticos
  when `ticos_packetizer_abort()` was called after a coredump was partially
  sent.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.11.2 and SDK 0.11.1 - Jan 21, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added support for nRF Connect SDK v1.2.x and updated the
  [integration guide](https://ticos.io/nrf-connect-sdk-integration-guide)
  accordingly.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.11.0 and SDK 0.10.1 - Jan 19, 2021

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added full support for the ESP8266 (Tensilica Xtensa LX106) MCU architecture!
  A step-by-step integration guide can be found
  [here](https://ticos.io/esp8266-tutorial) and the port to the ESP8266 RTOS SDK
  can be found [here](ports/esp8266_sdk/).

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a convenience header for picking up includes for all Ticos
  components. If you are using the
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), this path will
  be picked up automatically.

```c
#include "ticos/components.h"

// call to any Ticos API in the components folder
```

- Fixed a :bug: leading to Root CAs not get loaded correctly when using the nRF
  Connect SDK port and the `TICOS_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_TLS_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE=y`
  Kconfig option.
- Applied suggestions from @rerickson1 for the Zephyr and nRF Connect SDK ports:
  - [`CONFIG_TICOS_METRICS=y`](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/pull/8)
    can now be used to compile the metrics component into the Zephyr and nRF
    Connect SDK ports.
  - [`CONFIG_TICOS=y`](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/pull/7)
    must now be specified to enable the Ticos integration.

#### :house: Internal

- Refactored the [nRF Connect SDK port](ports/nrf-connect-sdk) to build directly
  on top of the [zephyr port](ports/zephyr) reducing code duplication and
  facilitate the rollout of additional features to both SDKs at the same time
  moving forward.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are using a Ticos
  [build system helper](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system) _and_ not using
  the trace or metrics functionality, you will now need to create a
  `ticos_trace_reason_user_config.def` or
  `ticos_metrics_heartbeat_config.def` file, respectively, and add it to your
  include path.
- When using the Zephyr port, the ticos integration must be enabled
  explicitly by adding `CONFIG_TICOS=y` to your `prj.conf`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.10.1 and SDK 0.10.0 - Jan 10, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Reference platform API implementations for the following MCUs/SDKs:
  - STM32F4 family / STM32CubeF4:
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCC CSR register](ports/stm32cube/f4/rcc_reboot_tracking.c)
  - STM32L4 family / STM32CubeL4
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCM SRS register](ports/stm32cube/l4/rcc_reboot_tracking.c)
  - nRF Connect SDK
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from PMU RESETREAS register](ports/nrf-connect-sdk/nrfx/pmu_reboot_tracking.c)
    - refactored HTTP port to support multiple backing storage strategies for
      root certificates. See
      [`TICOS_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_*`](ports/nrf-connect-sdk/zephyr/Kconfig)
      Kconfig options for more details
    - Added support for Ticos OTA downloads. See
      [ticos_nrfconnect_port_ota_update()](ports/nrf-connect-sdk/zephyr/include/ticos/nrfconnect_port/http.h)
      for more details

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.10.0 and SDK 0.9.2 - Jan 5, 2021

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Updated
  [`ticos_freertos_ram_regions.c`](ports/freertos/src/ticos_freertos_ram_regions.c)
  port to collect all TCBs and then stacks. This way, the state of all tasks can
  be recovered even if the coredump storage regin is filled while writing all
  the task stacks.
- Reference platform API implementations for the following MCUs/SDKs:
  - STM32F4 family / STM32CubeF4
    - [internal flash coredump storage](ports/stm32cube/f4/flash_coredump_storage.c)
  - STM32L4 family / STM32CubeL4
    - [internal flash coredump storage](ports/stm32cube/l4/flash_coredump_storage.c)
  - NXP's S32K1xx family / S32K1 SDL
    - [internal flash coredump storage using FTFC peripheral](ports/s32sdk/ftfc_flash_coredump_storage.c)
    - [software watchdog implementation using LPIT peripheral](ports/s32sdk/lpit_software_watchdog.c)
    - [rich reboot reason info derived from RCM SRS register](ports/s32sdk/rcm_reboot_tracking.c)
  - Silicon Lab's EFM/EFR family / v3.0 Gecko SDK
    - [internal flash coredump storage using MSC peripheral h](ports/emlib/msc_coredump_storage.c)
    - [software watchdog implementation using warning interrupt in WDOG peripheral](ports/emlib/wdog_software_watchdog.c)
    - [reboot reason info derived from RMU RSTCAUSE register](ports/emlib/rmu_reboot_tracking.c)

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added several more
  [reboot reason options](components/include/ticos/core/reboot_reason_types.h#L16):
  - `kMfltRebootReason_PinReset` for explicitly tracking external pin resets.
  - `kMfltRebootReason_SoftwareWatchdog` & `kMfltRebootReason_HardwareWatchdog`
    for easier disambiguation between watchdog resets where a coredump was
    captured versus ones where no software handler ran and hardware reset the
    device.
  - `kMfltRebootReason_ClockFailure` for explicit tracking of resets due to loss
    of a clock signal or PLL lock.
  - `kMfltRebootReason_Lockup` for explicit tracking of faults from within the
    Hardfault or NMI exceptions on ARM Cortex-M MCUs.
- Added a utility which can be used to verify a platform coredump storage
  implementation is working as corrected. For more details about how to use, see
  [ticos_coredump_storage_debug.c](components/panics/src/ticos_coredump_storage_debug.c#L1).

#### :house: Internal

- Added infrastructure to coredump collection in `panics` component to support
  ESP8266 (Tensilica Xtensa LX106) MCU architecture.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.9.3 and SDK 0.9.2 - Dec 14, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- nRF Connect Updates:

  - Updated port to support
    [nRF Connect SDK v1.4.0](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/v1.4-branch)
  - Added port of HTTP client to post data to Ticos
  - Added support for capturing state of all Zephyr tasks during a crash. This
    way the state of all threads can be seen in the Ticos UI when a crash is
    uploaded.
  - Updated
    [ticos_demo_app](examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160/ticos_demo_app) to
    use the nRF9160-DK
  - Added notes to the
    [step-by-step integration guide](https://ticos.io/nrf-connect-sdk-integration-guide)
    for the nRF9160.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.9.2 and SDK 0.9.1 - Dec 10, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added Ticos OTA support to esp-idf port. Updates can now be performed by
  calling `ticos_esp_port_ota_update()`. More details can be found in
  [`ports/esp_idf/ticos/include/ticos/esp_port/http_client.h`](ports/esp_idf/ticos/include/ticos/esp_port/http_client.h)
- The esp-idf port debug CLI can now easily be disabled by using the
  `TICOS_CLI_ENABLED=n` Kconfig option.
- Added FreeRTOS utility to facilitate collecting minimal set of RAM in a
  coredump necessary to recover backtraces for all tasks. More details can be
  found in
  [`ports/freertos/include/ticos/ports/freertos_coredump.h`](ports/freertos/include/ticos/ports/freertos_coredump.h)
- Previously, if the Ticos event storage buffer was out of space, a "storage
  out of space" error would be printed every time. Now, an error message is
  printed when the issue first happend and an info message is printed when space
  is free again.
- Added a reference software watchdog port for the STM32H7 series LPTIM
  peripheral. Users of the STM32 HAL can now compile in the reference port and
  the `TicosWatchdog_Handler`. The handler will save a coredump so the full
  system state can be recovered when a watchdog takes place. More details can be
  found in
  [`ports/include/ticos/ports/watchdog.h`](ports/include/ticos/ports/watchdog.h).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.9.1 and SDK 0.9.0 - Nov 24, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- A log can now be captured alongside a trace event by using a new API:
  [`TICOS_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(reason, ...)`](components/include/ticos/core/trace_event.h#L77).
  This can be useful to capture arbitrary diagnostic data with an error event or
  to capture critical error logs that you would like to be alerted on when they
  happen. For example:

```c
// @file ticos_trace_reason_user_config.def
TICOS_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(Critical_Log)
```

```c
// @file your_platform_log_implementation.h
#include "ticos/core/trace_event.h"

#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_CRITICAL(fmt, ....) \
    TICOS_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(Critical_Log, fmt, __VA_ARGS__)
```

```c
// @file your_platform_temperature_driver.c
void record_temperature(void) {
   // ...
   // erase flash to free up space
   int rv = spi_flash_erase(...);
   if (rv != 0) {
      YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_CRITICAL("Flash Erase Failure: rv=%d, spi_err=0x%x", spi_bus_get_status());
   }
}
```

- The error tracing facilities are now initialized automatically for the esp-idf
- Fixed a :bug: where an erroneous size was reported from
  `ticos_coredump_storage_check_size()` if
  `TICOS_COREDUMP_COLLECT_LOG_REGIONS=1`and `ticos_log_boot()` had not yet
  been called

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.9.0 and SDK 0.8.2 - Nov 16, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- ESP32 port improvements:
  - The Ticos `metrics` component is now included by default in the ESP32
    port
  - `TICOS_LOG_DEBUG` messages now print by default
  - Added a `heartbeat_dump` CLI command for easy viewing of current heartbeat
    metrics
  - Custom handling of collecting Ticos data can now easily be implemented in
    the ESP32 port using the new
    [`ticos_esp_port_data_available()` & `ticos_esp_port_get_chunk()`](ports/esp_idf/ticos/include/ticos/esp_port/core.h)
    APIS. This can be useful in scenarios where there are external MCUs
    forwarding Ticos chunks to the ESP32.
- The platform port for the ticos log dependency can now be implemented by
  macros (rather than the `ticos_platform_log` dependency). See
  [`components/include/ticos/core/debug_log.h`](components/include/ticos/core/debug_log.h)
  for more details.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were using the ESP32 port:
  - Call to `ticos_metrics_boot()` can now be removed
  - Custom implementations for `ticos_platform_metrics_timer_boot()` &
    `ticos_platform_get_time_since_boot_ms()` can be removed as they are now
    provided as part of the port.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.8.2 and SDK 0.8.1 - Nov 13, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Coredumps will now be truncated (instead of failing to save completely) when
  the memory regions requested take up more space than the platform storage
  allocated for saving. A warning will also be displayed in the Ticos UI when
  this happens. Regions are always read in the order returned from
  [`ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions()`](components/include/ticos/panics/platform/coredump.h)
  so it is recommended to order this list from the most to least important
  regions to capture.
- Updated FreeRTOS port to use static allocation APIs by default when the
  `configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION=1` configuration is used.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.8.1 and SDK 0.8.0 - Nov 3, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added several more
  [reboot reason options](components/include/ticos/core/reboot_reason_types.h#L16):
  `kMfltRebootReason_SoftwareReset` & `kMfltRebootReason_DeepSleep`.
- Extended [ESP32 port](https://ticos.io/esp-tutorial) to include integrations
  for [reboot reason tracking](https://ticos.io/reboot-reasons) and
  [log collection](https://ticos.io/logging).
- Apply missing check to unit test
  [reported on Github](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/pull/6)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.8.0 and SDK 0.7.2 - Oct 26, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a new convenience API,
  [`ticos_coredump_storage_check_size()`](components/include/ticos/panics/coredump.h),
  to check that coredump storage is appropriately sized.
- Fixed a :bug: with heartbeat timers that would lead to an incorrect duration
  being reported if the timer was started and stopped within the same
  millisecond.
- Fixed an issue when using TI's compiler that could lead to the incorrect
  register state being captured during a fault.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you were **not** using the
  [error tracing functionality](https://ticos.io/error-tracing), you will need to
  create the configuration file "ticos_trace_reason_user_config.def" and add
  it to your include path. This removes the requirement to manually define
  `TICOS_TRACE_REASON_USER_DEFS_FILE` as part of the compiler flags.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.7.3 and SDK 0.7.2 - Oct 5, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Add support for sending multiple events in a single chunk. This can be useful
  for optimizing throughput or packing more data into a single transmission
  unit. The behavior is disabled by default but can be enabled with the
  `TICOS_EVENT_STORAGE_READ_BATCHING_ENABLED` compiler flag. More details can
  be found in
  [ticos_event_storage.c](components/core/src/ticos_event_storage.c#L30)
- Added convenience API, `ticos_build_id_get_string`, for populating a buffer
  with a portion of the
  [Ticos Build ID](components/include/ticos/core/build_info.h#L8-L42) as a
  string.
- Added default implementations of several Ticos SDK dependency functions
  when using FreeRTOS to [ports/freertos](ports/freertos).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.7.2 and SDK 0.7.1 - Sept 1, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- A status or error code (i.e bluetooth disconnect reason, errno value, etc) can
  now be logged alongside a trace event by using a new API:
  [`TICOS_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS(reason, status_code)`](components/include/ticos/core/trace_event.h#L55).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.7.1 and SDK 0.7.0 - Sept 1, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added support for TI's ARM-CGT Compiler
- Removed dependency on NMI Exception Handler for `TICOS_ASSERT`s. Instead of
  pending an NMI exception, the assert path will now "trap" into the fault
  handler by executing a `udf` instruction. This unifies the fault handling
  paths within the SDK and leaves the NMI Handler free for other uses within the
  user's environment.
- Added several more
  [reboot reason options](components/include/ticos/core/reboot_reason_types.h#L16):
  `kMfltRebootReason_PowerOnReset`, `kMfltRebootReason_BrownOutReset`, &
  `kMfltRebootReason_Nmi`.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.7.0 and SDK 0.6.1 - Aug 6, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added utility to facilitate collection of the memory regions used by the
  [logging module](components/include/ticos/core/log.h) as part of a
  coredump. With this change, when the SDK is compiled with
  `TICOS_COREDUMP_COLLECT_LOG_REGIONS=1`, the logging region will
  automatically be collected as part of a coredump. Step-by-step details can
  also be found in the [logging integration guide](https://ticos.io/logging).
- Added `TICOS_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE_WITH_RANGE()` which can be used for
  defining the minimum and maximum expected range for a heartbeat metric. This
  information is used by the Ticos cloud to better normalize the data when it
  is presented in the UI.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system) and are using
  the `panics` component, you will need to manually add the following file to
  your build system:
  `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/panics/src/ticos_coredump_sdk_regions.c`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.6.1 and SDK 0.6.0 - July 27, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a port for projects using the [nRF Connect SDK](ports/nrf-connect-sdk)
  along with a
  [step-by-step integration guide](https://ticos.io/nrf-connect-sdk-integration-guide).
- Disabled optimizations for `ticos_data_export_chunk()` to guarantee the
  [GDB chunk test utility](https://ticos.io/send-chunks-via-gdb) can always be
  used to post chunks using the data export API.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.6.0 and SDK 0.5.1 - July 21, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added
  [ticos/core/data_export.h](components/include/ticos/core/data_export.h#L5)
  API to facilitate production and evaluation use cases where Ticos data is
  extracted over a log interface (i.e shell, uart console, log file, etc). See
  the header linked above or the
  [integration guide](https://ticos.io/chunk-data-export) for more details.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Fixed a :bug: that would cause the demo shell to get stuck if backspace
  chracters were entered while no other characters had been entered.
- Updated the [GDB chunk test utility](https://ticos.io/send-chunks-via-gdb) to
  automatically detect when the data export API is integrated and post-chunks to
  the cloud directly from GDB when the function is invoked.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system) and want to make
  use of the new data export API, you will need to manually add the following
  files to your build system:
  - Add: `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/ticos_data_export.c`
  - Add: `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/util/src/ticos_base64.c`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.5.1 and SDK 0.5.0 - June 24, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Updated code to support compilations with `-Wunused-paramater`, GNU GCC's
  `-Wformat-signedness`, and Clang's `-Wno-missing-prototypes` &
  `-Wno-missing-variable-declarations`.
- Updated unit test setup to compile with newly supported warnings treated as
  errors

#### :house: Internal

- Misc utility additions including support for encoding floats and int64_t's in
  the cbor utility

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.5.0 and SDK 0.4.2 - June 11, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Add additional utilities to the http component to facilitate easier
  [release management](https://ticos.io/release-mgmt) integration in environments
  with no pre-existing http stack.
- Add new cli command, `tcs get_latest_release`, to the Zephyr demo application
  (tested on the STM32L4) to demonstrate querying the Ticos cloud for new
  firmware updates.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Refactored `demo` component to make it easier to integrate an individual CLI
  commands into a project since some of the commands can be helpful for
  validating integrations. More details can be found in the README at
  [components/demo/README.md](components/demo/README.md).

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are using the "demo" component _and_ are _not_ making use our CMake or
  Make [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will
  need to make the following changes:
  - Update:
    `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/demo/src/{ticos_demo_cli.c => panics/ticos_demo_panics.c}`
  - Update:
    `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/demo/src/{ => panics}/ticos_demo_cli_aux.c`
  - Add: `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/demo/src/ticos_demo_core.c`
  - Add: `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/demo/src/http/ticos_demo_http.c`
- If you are using the `http` component, the following macro names changed:

```diff
-#define TICOS_HTTP_GET_API_PORT()
-#define TICOS_HTTP_GET_API_HOST()
+#define TICOS_HTTP_GET_CHUNKS_API_PORT()
+#define TICOS_HTTP_GET_CHUNKS_API_HOST()
```

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.4.2 and SDK 0.4.1 - June 8, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Moved `reboot_tracking.h` to `core` component since it has no dependencies on
  anything from the `panics` component. This allows the reboot tracking to be
  more easily integrated in a standalone fashion.
- [Published a new guide](https://ticos.io/release-mgmt) detailing how to manage
  firmware updates using Ticos.
- Disabled optimizations for `ticos_fault_handling_assert()`. This improves
  the recovery of local variables of frames in the backtrace when certain
  optimization levels are used.
- Updated `ticos_sdk_assert.c` to address a GCC warning
  (`-Wpointer-to-int-cast`) emitted when compiling the file for 64 bit
  architectures.
- Misc README improvements.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are already using reboot tracking in your system, you will need to
  update the following includes in your code:

```diff
-#include "ticos/panics/reboot_tracking.h"
-#include "ticos/panics/reboot_reason_types.h"
+#include "ticos/core/reboot_tracking.h"
+#include "ticos/panics/reboot_reason_types.h"
```

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will need
  to update the path for the following files:

  - `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/{panics => core}/src/ticos_ram_reboot_info_tracking.c`
  - `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/{panics => core}/src/ticos_reboot_tracking_serializer.c`

- `eMfltResetReason` was renamed to `eTicosRebootReason`.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.4.1 and SDK 0.4.0 - May 20, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added native SDK support for tracking and generating a unique firmware build
  id with any compiler! Quick integration steps can be found in
  [ticos/core/build_info.h](components/include/ticos/core/build_info.h#L8-L42).
  It is very common, especially during development, to not change the firmware
  version between editing and compiling the code. This will lead to issues when
  recovering backtraces or symbol information because the debug information in
  the symbol file may be out of sync with the actual binary. Tracking a build id
  enables the Ticos cloud to identify and surface when this happens! You can
  also make use of two new APIs:
  - `ticos_build_info_dump()` can be called on boot to display the build that
    is running. This can be a useful way to sanity check that your debugger
    succesfully flashed a new image.
  - `ticos_build_info_read()` can be used to read the build id for your own
    use cases. For example you could append a portion of it to a debug version
    to make it unique.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- The CMake [build system helper](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system) is now
  compatible with any 3.x version of CMake (previously required 3.6 or newer).
- The unique firmware build id is stored automatically as part of coredump
  collection.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will need
  to add the following files to your build:
  - `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/ticos_build_id.c`
  - `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/ticos_core_utils.c`
- We also encourage you to add a
  [unique build id](components/include/ticos/core/build_info.h#L8-L42) to
  your build (several line code change).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.4.0 and SDK 0.3.4 - May 6, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added support for (optionally) storing events collected by the SDK to
  non-volatile storage mediums. This can be useful for devices which experience
  prolonged periods of no connectivity. To leverage the feature, an end user
  must implement the
  [nonvolatile_event_storage platform API](components/include/ticos/core/platform/nonvolatile_event_storage.h#L7).

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added an assert used internally by the SDK which makes it easier to debug API
  misuse during bringup. The assert is enabled by default but can easily be
  disabled or overriden. For more details see
  [`ticos/core/sdk_assert.h`](components/include/ticos/core/sdk_assert.h#L6).
- Added a default implementation of
  [`ticos_platform_halt_if_debugging()`](components/core/src/arch_arm_cortex_m.c#L20-L34)
  for Cortex-M targets. The function is defined as _weak_ so a user can still
  define the function to override the default behavior.

#### :house: Internal

- Updated
  [`ticos install_chunk_handler`](https://ticos.io/posting-chunks-with-gdb) to
  work with older versions of the GNU Arm Toolchain.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will need
  to add `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/ticos_sdk_assert.c` to
  your project.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.3.4 and SDK 0.3.3 - April 22, 2020

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Moved `trace_event.h` to `core` component since it has no dependencies on
  anything from the `panics` component. This allows the trace event feature to
  be more easily integrated in a standalone fashion.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- If you are already using `TICOS_TRACE_EVENT()` in your project, you will
  need to update the include as follows:

```diff
-#include "ticos/panics/trace_event.h"
+#include "ticos/core/trace_event.h"
```

- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will need
  to update the source path for `components/panics/src/ticos_trace_event.c`
  to `components/core/src/ticos_trace_event.c`

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.3.3 and SDK 0.3.2 - April 21, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added a new [GDB command](https://ticos.io/posting-chunks-with-gdb) which can
  be used to post packetized Ticos data directly from GDB to the Ticos
  cloud. This can be helpful as a way to quickly test data collection
  functionality while working on an integration of the SDK.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.3.2 and SDK 0.3.1 - April 16, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- The `captured_date` for an event can now be set by implementing
  [`ticos_platform_time_get_current()`](components/include/ticos/core/platform/system_time.h#L33).
  If the API is not implemented, the `captured_date` will continue to be set
  based on the time the event was received by the ticos cloud.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a reference implementation of
  [reboot reason tracking](https://ticos.io/2QlOlgH) to the
  [NRF52 demo app](examples/nrf5/libraries/ticos/platform_reference_impl/ticos_platform_reboot_tracking.c#L1)
  and a new `reboot` CLI command to easily exercise it.
- A `reset_reason` can now optionally be provided as part of
  [`sResetBootupInfo`](components/include/ticos/core/reboot_tracking.h#L41).
  This can be useful for scenarios where the reboot reason is known on bootup
  but could not be set prior to the device crashing.
- A reboot reason event will now _always_ be generated when
  `ticos_reboot_tracking_boot()` is called even if no information about the
  reboot has been provided. In this scenario, the reset reason will be
  [`kMfltRebootReason_Unknown`](components/include/ticos/core/reboot_reason_types.h#L16)

#### :house: Internal

- Updated a few Kconfig options in the Zephyr demo app to improve the ability to
  compute stack high water marks (`CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y`) and determine if
  stacks has overflowed (`CONFIG_MPU_STACK_GUARD=y`).

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- `device_serial` is no longer encoded by default as part of events. Instead,
  the `device_serial` in an event is populated from the the unique device
  identifier used when posting the data to the
  [chunks REST endpoint](https://ticos.io/chunks-api). This leads to ~20%
  reduction in the size of a typical event. Encoding `device_serial` as part of
  the event itself can still be enabled by adding
  [`-DTICOS_EVENT_INCLUDE_DEVICE_SERIAL=1`](components/core/src/ticos_serializer_helper.c#L23)
  as a compilation flag but should not be necessary for a typical integration.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.3.1 and SDK 0.3.0 - April 9, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Added [`ticos_log_read()`](components/include/ticos/core/log.h#L95-L121)
  API to make it possible to use the module to cache logs in RAM and then flush
  them out to slower mediums, such as a UART console or Flash, from a background
  task.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- A pointer to the stack frame upon exception entry is now included in
  `sCoredumpCrashInfo` when
  [ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions](components/include/ticos/panics/platform/coredump.h#L56)
  is invoked. This can (optionally) be used to configure regions collected based
  on the state or run platform specific cleanup based on the state.
- Added Root Certificates needed for release downloads to
  [`TICOS_ROOT_CERTS_PEM`](components/http/include/ticos/http/root_certs.h#L146).

#### :house: Internal

- All sources that generate events now use the same utility function,
  `ticos_serializer_helper_encode_metadata()` to encode common event data.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.3.0 and SDK 0.2.5 - April 3, 2020

#### :rocket: New Features

- Introduced a lightweight logging module. When used, the logs leading up to a
  crash will now be decoded and displayed from the Ticos Issue Details Web
  UI. For instructions about how to use the module in your project, check out
  [log.h](components/include/ticos/core/log.h).
- The metrics component will now automatically collect the elapsed time and the
  number of unexpected reboots during a heartbeat interval. The Ticos cloud
  now uses this information to automatically compute and display the overall
  uptime of your fleet.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

- Added a [new document](https://ticos.io/fw-event-serialization) walking through
  the design of Ticos event serialization.
- Cleaned up `test_ticos_root_cert.cpp` and moved the `base64` implementation
  within the unit test to the `util` component so it is easier to share the code
  elsewhere in the future.
- Added `const` to a few circular_buffer.h API signatures.
- Misc code comment improvements.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- The function signature for `ticos_metrics_boot()` changed as part of this
  update. If you are already using the `metrics` component, you will need to
  update the call accordingly. See the notes in
  [metrics.h](components/include/ticos/metrics/metrics.h) for more details.
- If you are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), you will need
  to add `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/ticos_log.c` to your
  project. (Note that until
  [`ticos_log_boot()`](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/ticos/core/log.h#L33-L38)
  is called, all calls made to the logging module will be a no-op).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.5 and SDK 0.2.4 - March 20, 2020

- Improve the `ticos_platform_coredump_storage_clear()` NRF52 reference
  implementation for situations where the SoftDevice is enabled and there is a
  lot of Bluetooth activity. (In this scenario, NRF52 flash operations may need
  retries or take a while to complete).
- Fixed compiler error that could arise with the metrics component when using
  Arm Compiler 5 due to multiply defined weak symbols.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.4 and SDK 0.2.3 - March 10, 2020

- Add support for ESP32 (Tensilica Xtensa LX6 MCU) to the **panics** component.
  - A step-by-step integration guide can be found
    [here](https://ticos.io/esp-tutorial).
  - A drop-in port for an existing v3.x or v4.x based ESP-IDF project can be
    found at [ports/esp_idf](ports/esp_idf).
  - An example application exercising the ticos-firmware-sdk can be found
    [here](examples/esp32/README.md).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.3 and SDK 0.2.2 - March 3, 2020

- If a [software watchdog](https://ticos.io/root-cause-watchdogs) has been
  implemented on a Cortex-M device, `TicosWatchdog_Handler` can now be
  registered as the Exception Handler to automatically collect a coredump.
- For heartbeat metrics, instead of serializing the name of each metric, we now
  recover it from the debug information in the symbol file in the Ticos
  cloud. For a typical heartbeat this reduces the serialization size by more
  than 50% and results in a smaller footprint than other structured
  serialization alternatives such as Protobuf.
- Remove usage of `__has_include` macro for IAR compiler since not all versions
  fully support it.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.1 and SDK 0.2.2 - Feb 20, 2020

- Add support for calling `TICOS_TRACE_EVENT()` from interrupts. Note: If you
  are _not_ using our CMake or Make
  [build system helpers](README.md#add-sources-to-build-system), this change
  requires that you add
  `$(TICOS_SDK_ROOT)/components/core/src/arch_arm_cortex_m.c` to your
  project.
- Misc documentation improvements.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.0 and SDK 0.2.1 - Feb 14, 2020

- Add support for compressing coredumps as they are sent using Run Length
  Encoding (RLE). More details can be found in
  [ticos/core/data_source_rle.h](components/include/ticos/core/data_source_rle.h).
- Update **metrics** component to support compilation with the IAR ARM C/C++
  Compiler.
- Update Mbed OS 5 port to use `ticos_demo_shell` instead `mbed-client-cli`,
  since `mbed-client-cli` is not part of the main Mbed OS 5 distribution.
- Update nrf52 example application to only collect the active parts of the stack
  to reduce the overall size of the example coredump.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.2.0 and SDK 0.1.0 - Feb 5, 2020

- Add a new API ("Trace Event") for tracking errors. This allows for tracing
  issues that are unexpected but are non-fatal (don't result in a device
  reboot). A step-by-step guide detailing how to use the feature can be found
  at: https://ticos.io/error-tracing
- Update GDB coredump collection script to work with the ESP32 (Tensilica Xtensa
  LX6 Architecture)
- Remove `__task` from IAR Cortex-M function handler declarations since it's not
  explicitly required and can lead to a compiler issue if the function prototype
  does not also use it.
- Misc documentation and comment tweaks to make nomenclature more consistent

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.1.0 and SDK 0.0.18 - Jan 22, 2020

- Update **panics** component to support compilation with IAR ARM C/C++
  Compiler. More details about integrating IAR can be found at
  https://ticos.io/iar-tutorial. As part of the change `TICOS_GET_LR()` now
  takes an argument which is the location to store the LR to
  (`void *lr = TICOS_GET_LR()` -> `void *lr;` `TICOS_GET_LR(lr)`)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.18 and SDK 0.0.17 - Jan 14, 2020

- Update the chunk protocol to encode CRC in last chunk of message instead of
  first. This allows the CRC to be computed incrementally and the underlying
  message to be read once (instead of twice). It also makes it easier to use the
  data packetizer in environments where reads from data sources need to be
  performed asynchronously. More details can be found at
  https://ticos.io/data-to-cloud
- Fixed a couple documentation links

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.17 and SDK 0.0.16 - Jan 7, 2020

- Guarantee that all accesses to the platform coredump storage region route
  through `ticos_coredump_read` while the system is running.
- Scrub unused portion of out buffer provided to packetizer with a known pattern
  for easier debugging

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.16 and SDK 0.0.15 - Jan 6, 2020

- Add convenience API, `ticos_packetizer_get_chunk()`, to
  [data_packetizer](components/include/ticos/core/data_packetizer.h) module.
- Add a new eMfltCoredumpRegionType, `MemoryWordAccessOnly` which can be used to
  force the region to be read 32 bits at a time. This can be useful for
  accessing certain peripheral register ranges which are not byte addressable.
- Automatically collect Exception / ISR state for Cortex-M based targets. NOTE
  that the default config requires an additional ~150 bytes of coredump storage.
  The feature can be disabled completely by adding
  `-DTICOS_COLLECT_INTERRUPT_STATE=0` to your compiler flags. More
  configuration options can be found in
  [ticos_coredump_regions_armv7.c](components/panics/src/ticos_coredump_regions_armv7.c).
- Improve documentation about integrating the SDK within a project in README
- Update Release note summary to use markdown headings for easier referencing.
- Update try script used to collect coredumps via GDB to also collect
  Exception/ISR register information.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.15 and SDK 0.0.14 - Dec 19, 2019

- Add ARMv6-M fault handling port to **panics** component for MCUs such as the
  ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.14 and SDK 0.0.13 - Dec 18, 2019

- Update **panics** component to support compilation with Arm Compiler 5.

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.13 and SDK 0.0.12 - Dec 16, 2019

- Updated Cortex-M fault handler in **panics** component to also collect `psp`
  and `msp` registers when the system crashes. This allows for the running
  thread backtrace to be more reliably recovered when a crash occurs from an
  ISR.
- Added optional `TICOS_EXC_HANDLER_...` preprocessor defines to enable
  custom naming of exception handlers in the **panics** component.
- Add port for Cortex-M based targets using Quantum Leaps' QP‚Ñ¢/C & QP‚Ñ¢/C++
  real-time embedded framework. See [ports/qp/README.md](ports/qp/README.md) for
  more details.
- Add demo application running Quantum Leaps' QP‚Ñ¢/C running on the
  [STM32F407 discovery board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html).
  See [examples/qp/README.md](examples/qp/README.md) for more details.
- Added demo application and port for Arm Mbed OS 5 running on the
  [STM32F429I-DISC1 evaluation board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html).
  See [examples/mbed/README.md](examples/mbed/README.md) for more details.
- Changed `print_core` to `print_chunk` in demo applications to better align
  with the Ticos nomenclature for
  [data transfer](https://ticos.io/data-to-cloud).

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.12 and SDK 0.0.11 - Dec 4, 2019

- Expose root certificates used by Ticos CI in DER format for easier
  integration with TLS libraries which do not parse PEM formatted certificates.
- Add utilities to the http component for constructing Ticos cloud **chunk**
  endpoint POST requests to facilitate easier integration in environments with

- Add port for Cortex-M based targets in the Zephyr RTOS. Ports are available
  for the 1.14 Long Term Support Release as well as the 2.0 Release. See
  [ports/zephyr/README.md](ports/zephyr/README.md) for more details
- Add Zephyr demo application (tested on the STM32L4). See
  [zephyr demo app directory](examples/zephyr/README.md) for more details

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.11 and SDK 0.0.10 - Nov 25, 2019

- Release of **metrics** component. This API can easily be used to monitor
  device health over time (i.e connectivity, battery life, MCU resource
  utilization, hardware degradation, etc) and configure Alerts with the Ticos
  backend when things go astray. To get started, see this
  [document](https://ticos.io/2D8TRLX)

### Changes between Ticos SDK 0.0.10 and SDK 0.0.9 - Nov 22, 2019

- Updated `ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions()` to take an additional
  argument, `crash_info` which conveys information about the crash taking place
  (trace reason & stack pointer at time of crash). This allows platform ports to
  dynamically change the regions collected based on the crash if so desired.
  This will require an update that looks like the following to your port:

```diff
-const sMfltCoredumpRegion *ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions(size_t *num_regions) {
+const sMfltCoredumpRegion *ticos_platform_coredump_get_regions(
+    const sCoredumpCrashInfo *crash_info, size_t *num_regions) {
```

- Added a new API, `ticos_coredump_storage_compute_size_required()` which can
  be called on boot to sanity check that platform coredump storage is large
  enough to hold a coredump. For example:

```
  sMfltCoredumpStorageInfo storage_info = { 0 };
  ticos_platform_coredump_storage_get_info(&storage_info);
  const size_t size_needed = ticos_coredump_storage_compute_size_required();
  if (size_needed > storage_info.size) {
    TICOS_LOG_ERROR("Coredump storage too small. Got %d B, need %d B",
                       storage_info.size, size_needed);
  }
  TICOS_ASSERT(size_needed <= storage_info.size);
```

- Added a convenience RAM backed
  [reference port](https://github.com/ticos/ticos-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/panics/src/ticos_platform_ram_backed_coredump.c)
  for coredump platform APIs. This can be used for persisting a coredump in RAM
  across a reset.

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.9 and 0.0.8 - Nov 15, 2019

- Enhanced Reboot Tracking module within the **panics** component. Reboots that
  don't result in coredumps can now be easily tracked (i.e brown outs, system
  watchdogs, user initiated resets, resets due to firmware updates, etc). See
  `ticos/core/reboot_tracking.h` for more details and https://ticos.io/2QlOlgH
  for a step-by-step setup tutorial.
- Added Event Storage module within the **core** component. This is a small RAM
  backed data store that queues up traces to be published to the Ticos cloud.
  To minimize the space needed and transport overhead, all events collected
  within the SDK are stored using the Concise Binary Object Representation
  (CBOR)

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.8 and 0.0.7 - Nov 7, 2019

- Added helper makefile (`makefiles/TicosWorker.mk`). A user of the SDK can
  include this makefile when using a make as their build system to easily
  collect the sources and include paths needed to build Ticos SDK components
- Make unit tests public & add CI to external SDK

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.7 and 0.0.6 - Oct 31, 2019

- Added firmware side support for the Ticos cloud **chunk** endpoint. This is
  a sessionless endpoint that allows chunks of arbitrary size to be sent and
  reassembled in the Ticos cloud. This transport can be used to publish _any_
  data collected by the Ticos SDK. The data is read out on the SDK side by
  calling the `ticos_packetizer_get_next()` API in `data_packetizer.h`. More
  details [here](https://ticos.io/data-to-cloud)
- Updated demo apps to use the new **chunk** endpoint
- Added a new _weak_ function, `ticos_coredump_read()` so platform ports can
  easily add locking on reads to coredump storage if necessary for transmission.
- Updates to this version of the sdk will require the **util** component get
  compiled when using the **panics** API

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.6 and 0.0.5 - Oct 14, 2019

- Added example port and demo for the STM32H743I-NUCLEO144 evaluation board
  running ChibiOS. See `examples/stm32/stm32h743i/README.md` for more details.
- general README documentation improvements
- Fixed compilation error that could arise in `ticos_fault_handling_arm.c`
  when using old versions of GCC

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.5 and 0.0.4 - September 23, 2019

- Updated **panics** SDK to support complex hardware toplogies such as systems
  with multiple MCUs or systems running multiple binaries on a single MCU. More
  details [here](https://ticos.io/34PyNGQ). Users of the SDK will need to update
  the implementation for `ticos_platform_get_device_info()`
- Updated all ports to be in sync with SDK updates

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.4 and 0.0.3 - August 19, 2019

- Updated **panics** core code to _always_ collect fault registers for ARMv6-M &
  ARMv7-M architectures. The Ticos cloud will auto-analyze these and present
  an analysis.
- Updated https://try.ticos.com gdb script to collect Cortex-M MPU region
  information for auto-analysis
- general README documentation improvements
- improved error reporting strategy and documentation in
  `ticos/core/errors.h`

### Changes between Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.3 and 0.0.2 - July 2, 2019

- added example port and demo of **panics** SDK for the Nordic nRF52840
  (PCA10056) development kit. See `examples/nrf5/README.md` for more details.
- Made SDK headers suitable for includion in C++ files

First Public Release of Ticos Firmware SDK 0.0.2 - June 26, 2019

- published initial Ticos SDK, see `README.md` in root for summary
- published **panics** API which is a C SDK that can be integrated into any
  Cortex-M device to save a "core" (crash state) on faults and system asserts.
  See`components/panics/README.md` for more details
- Added example port and demo of **panics** SDK for the BCM943364WCD1 evaluation
  board running the WICED Wifi stack. More details in `examples/wiced/README.md`
- add python invoke based CLI wrapper for demo ports
