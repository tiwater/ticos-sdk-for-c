//! Three checks:
//!  - First check if major version is greater than the one specified
//!  - Next check if the major version matches and the minor version is greater
//!  - Finally check if we are on a development build that is greater than the version.  After a
//!    release is shipped, a PATCHLEVEL of 99 is used to indicate this. For example, a version of
//!    "1.7.99" means development for version "1.8.0".
